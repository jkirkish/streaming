# streamingYou are a famous detective who got called into a huge case for the FBI.  Somebody forgot to use Pascal Case for a class name! Oh no! Luckily for the local PD, they have you to help them solve who did it.  The local sheriff says he has lined up 5 suspects each with their own unique sets of looks and clothing.  To really get to the nitty and gritty, you’ll need to map and organize them into groups using a set of criteria.


Luckily for you, you're a programmer who knows streams to easily figure this out.   The sheriff prints out a list of suspects and hands it to you….
